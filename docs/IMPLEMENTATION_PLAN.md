# Implementation Plan

Status: ACTIVE (created Phase 0, 2026-10-09).

Statuses: `NOT STARTED` · `IN PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED` · `IMPLEMENTED` · `VERIFIED`.
`IMPLEMENTED` ≠ `VERIFIED`: a task is VERIFIED only after its acceptance
criteria were tested and evidence recorded in `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

Priority mapping: P0 = essential working core, P1 = core completeness,
P2 = planned wow-factor (Kubernetes/Helm — investigated early, never abandoned).

Dependency notation: "→" means "depends on".

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Node Lifecycle Core (P0)

| ID | Task | Deps | Pri | Acceptance criteria | Verification | Status |
|----|------|------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| T-1.1 | Scaffold npm-workspaces monorepo (TS strict, eslint, vitest, root scripts) | — | P0 | `npm install` + `npm run build` + `npm test` pass on empty-ish packages; layout matches ARCHITECTURE §11 | run commands; CI-ready output | VERIFIED |
| T-1.2 | Engine core types + StateStore (SQLite: networks, nodes, runs, history) | T-1.1 | P0 | typed models for NetworkDefinition/NodeConfig/OperationResult; migrations run; store unit-tested | vitest unit tests | VERIFIED |
| T-1.3 | BinaryManager: download `portaldot_dev`+`subkey`, cache in `.kaizen/bin`, SHA-256 TOFU record | T-1.2 | P0 | fresh env can fetch binary; hash recorded; `--version` runs from cache; idempotent re-run | integration test w/ real download (env-gated) | VERIFIED |
| T-1.4 | NodeProcessManager: argv-array spawn, per-node base-path, port allocation, log capture, SIGTERM→SIGKILL stop, restart, DB-wedge detection | T-1.3 | P0 | start dev node → reaches block production; stop within timeout; no orphan procs; SIGKILL+restart recovers DB; wedge detected | integration test vs real node | VERIFIED (see note †) |
| T-1.5 | PortaldotRpcClient (@polkadot/api over WS): health/peers/sync/header/events; reconnect w/ backoff | T-1.3 | P0 | WS client connects to live node; returns typed snapshots; survives node restart (reconnects) | integration test vs real node | VERIFIED |
| T-1.6 | NetworkService: single + two-node presets via build-spec chain-spec generation; create/start/stop/inspect services | T-1.4, T-1.5 | P0 | one call creates a real 2-node network that peers and finalizes; inspect returns real peerIds/heights | integration test replicating Phase 0 experiment through the engine | VERIFIED |
| T-1.7 | CLI skeleton (`kaizen network create/start/stop/status`, `--json`) | T-1.6 | P0 | CLI drives the same services; `--json` output parseable; exit codes correct | shell-driven smoke test w/ real network | VERIFIED |
| T-1.8 | API skeleton (Fastify REST + Zod validation + WS event bus) | T-1.6 | P0 | REST endpoints mirror engine ops; invalid input → 400 with structured error; WS streams engine events | supertest + live smoke | VERIFIED |
| T-1.9 | Phase-1 test suite + docs update (PROGRESS/TESTING/RESEARCH status flips) | T-1.7, T-1.8 | P0 | suite green; evidence recorded | `npm test`; docs diff review | VERIFIED |

† T-1.4 "wedge detected" split: **crash/wedge *death* detection** (unexpected
exit → `crashed` state + log tail; startup wedge → `STARTUP_FAILED`) and
cross-process **adopted stop** (CLI short-lived processes vs daemon nodes) are
implemented and live-verified in Phase 1. **Alive-but-stalled runtime
detection** (process healthy, no blocks — the Phase 0 DB-wedge signature) is
monitoring work and lives in **T-2.4** (MonitoringService state machine), as
planned.

## Phase 2A — Topology Engine & Live Monitoring (P0)

Split from Phase 2 (2026-10-10): engine-side topology/monitoring/API work is
completed and verified BEFORE any UI work starts (T-2.5…T-2.7 remain Phase 2B).

| ID | Task | Deps | Pri | Acceptance criteria | Verification | Status |
|----|------|------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| T-2.1 | Inspect Local Testnet genesis authorities; topology preset model as data (single/two/four-validator/validator-fullnode/custom) with pure validation | T-1.6 | P0 | authority set documented in RESEARCH (R-05 flip); presets+custom validation pure and unit-tested; invalid topologies rejected before any side effect | unit tests + live spike evidence in PROGRESS | VERIFIED |
| T-2.2 | ChainSpecService: per-network spec generation (plain → authority patch with binary-derived keys → raw), audit sidecar, purge/reset support | T-2.1 | P0 | 4-authority patched spec generated from the real binary; sidecar records baked-in authorities; purge resets chain data but keeps identity | unit tests (fake binary) + live 4-validator test | VERIFIED |
| T-2.3 | Four-validator + validator+fullnode + custom presets; ordered start/stop; per-node start/stop; expected-peer verification | T-2.2 | P0 | 4 validators full-mesh with all four authoring + finality; full node syncs and authors nothing; node-level ops work; stop/start cycles clean | live integration tests | VERIFIED |
| T-2.4 | MonitoringService: HTTP RPC sampling loop, health state machine (unknown/healthy/unhealthy/unavailable/stale), overlap prevention, typed monitor events, auto-cleanup on network stop | T-1.5, T-2.3 | P0 | samples ≥1/2s cadence; crash → unhealthy with reason; unreachable → unavailable; loop never overlaps; polling stops with the network | unit tests + live monitoring test | VERIFIED |
| T-2.8 | API/WS surface extension: network CRUD + lifecycle + purge, node detail/start/stop, monitoring snapshots, typed events (network.created, monitor.*) with validation and structured errors | T-2.4, T-1.8 | P0 | REST endpoints mirror engine services only; invalid input → structured 400/404/409; WS streams typed monitor/network events with timestamps+ids | live API integration tests (REST + WS) | VERIFIED |
| T-2.9 | Phase 2A test suite + docs (PROGRESS/PLAN/RESEARCH/DECISIONS/TESTING/RISKS/ARCHITECTURE/README) + phase report | T-2.3, T-2.4, T-2.8 | P0 | suite green; evidence recorded; IMPLEMENTED vs VERIFIED distinguished; report written | `npm test`, live suite, docs diff review | VERIFIED |

## Phase 2B — Web UI (P0, complete)

Built on the Phase 2A API/engine. The UI renders ONLY real API/WS data
(DEC-009); the browser never launches processes — every operation goes
through the backend (FR-1).

| ID | Task | Deps | Pri | Acceptance criteria | Verification | Status |
|----|------|------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| T-2.5 | Web app scaffold (Vite+React): layout, typed API client, WS client with reconnect, network list/create view, Overview/Events screens | T-1.8, T-2.8 | P0 | UI creates and lists real networks; no mock data anywhere | component tests (jsdom) + live client test against real backend | VERIFIED |
| T-2.6 | Live network dashboard: network detail (identity, nodes, live monitoring table with peers/head/finalized/sync/health, lifecycle controls) + node detail page | T-2.4, T-2.5 | P0 | live values update in real time from a real network; unreachable fields shown explicitly, never invented | component tests + `webclient.int.test.ts` (real nodes; values cross-checked vs raw RPC). NOTE: live tables poll REST at a bounded 5s cadence (paused when not running); WS events drive invalidation + the event feed — real-time, but not per-value WS pushes | VERIFIED |
| T-2.7 | Log capture & tail API/UI: engine `nodeLogTail`, `GET …/nodes/:nodeId/logs`, node-detail log pane with bounded auto-refresh while running | T-2.2, T-2.5 | P1 | tail works for any managed node; UI shows real log bytes | live webclient test (real log bytes from a running node) + component tests. Scope note: bounded-refresh follow, no since-timestamp streaming | VERIFIED |
| T-2.10 | Phase 2B test suite + docs (PLAN/PROGRESS/ARCHITECTURE/TESTING/RISKS/README) + phase report (2A report archived) | T-2.5, T-2.6, T-2.7 | P0 | suite green; evidence recorded; IMPLEMENTED vs VERIFIED distinguished; report written | `npm test`, live suite, docs diff review | VERIFIED |

## Phase 3 — Failure Lab & Scenarios (P0)

| ID | Task | Deps | Pri | Acceptance criteria | Verification | Status |
|----|------|------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| T-3.1 | Fault mechanism study: peer disconnect (reserved-peer RPC vs rewire), pause (SIGSTOP/SIGCONT), partition (isolation strategy) on single host | T-2.3 | P0 | each mechanism proven with evidence; documented in RESEARCH | capability matrix R-22 (TECHNICAL_RESEARCH); 10 recorded spike runs (`test/experiments/t31-spike.mjs`, logs `t31-*.log`); gates green (typecheck/lint/build/unit 113/live 30) | VERIFIED 2026-10-12 (B1/C1/C3 partial — negative results proven; see R-22) |

| T-3.4 | ScenarioEngine execution w/ per-action recording (timestamps, results, errors) + cancellation | T-3.3 | P0 | scenario runs against live network; history complete incl. failures | `scenario-run.test.ts` 37 unit (state machines, all 10 pre-execution gates as persisted refusals, step order/evidence, policies incl. inconclusive, timeouts, cancellation, cleanup-failure quarantine, crash reconciliation, shutdown); `apps/api/test/scenario-runs.test.ts` 9 (202 execute flow, status/list/cancel, gate refusals as 4xx + persisted rejected runs, no-injector guarantee); `scenario-runs.int.test.ts` LIVE 8/8 against real `portaldot_dev` (pause w/ independent effect+recovery observation, sequential steps, precondition abort + live skip-step, cancel during hold, STEP_TIMEOUT, phantom-network + label gates); gates green (typecheck/lint/build/unit 248, live 43); PROGRESS 2026-10-16 (Phase 3D) | VERIFIED 2026-10-16 (execution is engine-side only; CLI/UI surfaces are T-3.6, replay is T-3.5) |
| T-3.5 | Replay (deterministic action replay with documented semantics) | T-3.4 | P0 | replay re-executes same action sequence; UI/CLI states replay≠identical-outcome | `scenario-replay.test.ts` 10 unit (distinct run + provenance, source immutability, snapshot vs edited/deleted scenario, eligibility rules incl. rejected/unfinished/malformed, auth posture, gate re-evaluation incl. quarantine/conflict/unsupported op, failed-source semantics, cancel + STEP_TIMEOUT on replays, duplicate-replay conflict, `?replayOf` query, store reopen); `apps/api/test/scenario-runs.test.ts` +4 = 13 (202 replay + replayNote + source untouched over the wire, 400/404/409 validation, persisted rejections with provenance, concurrent duplicate 409); `scenario-runs.int.test.ts` LIVE 9/9 (replay on real `portaldot_dev`: fresh effect sampled independently, fresh fault id, source byte-identical, provenance query, ineligible/unknown-target refusals); gates green (typecheck/lint/build/unit 262, live 44); PROGRESS 2026-10-18 (Phase 3E) | VERIFIED 2026-10-18 (replay reuses the T-3.4 executor unchanged; DEC-022) |
| T-3.6 | CLI + API + UI surfaces for Failure Lab & scenarios | T-3.4, T-2.5 | P0 | full flow usable from both CLI and UI | e2e smoke | **PARTIAL — T-3.6A VERIFIED 2026-10-21 (CLI + API audit); T-3.6B IMPLEMENTED 2026-10-21 (web UI, jsdom-verified)**: CLI `kaizen scenario …` / `kaizen run …` over the shared engine (see DEC-024/DEC-025). Web: imported console design wired to the typed client + WS (Failure Lab, Scenarios, run cancel/replay, V3 hand-off). **REMAINING for VERIFIED**: a live UI smoke against a running portaldot_dev network (real browser or webclient-style transport test) — not possible on the arm64 sandbox this session (no x86_64 userland; RSK-31). See PHASE_REPORT (Phase 3F/8B) |
| T-3.6B | Web-UI integration of the imported console design (framer-motion) over the real API: shell + lifecycle stepper, Overview live topology, node drawer (detail/logs/diagnostics/start-stop), Failure Lab (pause/terminate execute after confirm, dry-run, live fault log, roll back), Scenarios (CRUD/validate/execute/cancel/replay), Incidents (fault evidence), Deployments (local processes), Validators, Settings; unbuilt features disabled + labelled with their phase | T-3.6A, T-2.5 | P0 | every screen renders only API/WS data; destructive actions confirm first; blocked/planned features labelled, never simulated (DEC-009); gates green | 49 web unit/jsdom tests (6 files: shell, overview, drawer, lab, scenarios, create, validators, incidents, deployments, settings, view-model) + typecheck/lint/build; live UI smoke PENDING (RSK-23, RSK-31) | IMPLEMENTED |
| T-3.6C | Console + landing match the original Kaizen design (p001–p009): bundled fonts (Hanken Grotesk / Bodoni Moda / Source Code Pro), full landing (stats, is/isn't, lifecycle wave, break-one illustration, one-line commands, Proven on Portaldot V3, where it runs, six ways, FAQ, CTA, footer), console shell (sidebar, lifecycle pills, network chip, watermarks), Overview/Failure Lab/failure-active/Incident/Deployments layouts on real data, Networks page; real `kaizen up` CLI command | T-3.6B | P0 | design layouts render real API/WS data only; unbuilt targets labelled (Docker/K8s Phase 6, disconnect/partition R-22); gates green | 61 web jsdom tests + 5 `kaizen up` tests (fake engine) + typecheck/lint/build; headless-Chromium screenshots over fixture API (docs/assets/ui); live UI smoke and live `kaizen up` PENDING (RSK-23, RSK-31) | IMPLEMENTED |

## Phase 8 — V3 Connectivity (external endpoints) 

No `PHASE_8_PLAN.md` was supplied with the T-8.1 brief (2026-10-19); this
section records the task exactly as scoped there. T-8.2 (on-chain run
anchoring) was briefed for the Portaldot Hacker House Week 2 submission
(2026-10-21) and is recorded below. Wallet authorization / other T-8.x work
remains **undefined and not started**.

| ID | Task | Deps | Pri | Acceptance criteria | Verification | Status |
|----|------|------|-----|---------------------|--------------|--------|

## Milestone Gates

- **G1 (end Phase 1)**: engine can manage a real single node end-to-end; API+CLI exist.
- **G2 (end Phase 2)**: 4-node network created from UI with live monitoring.
- **G3 (end Phase 4)**: full BREAK→DIAGNOSE→RECOVER loop demonstrated with history.
- **G4 (end Phase 6)**: Helm deploys the same network class to minikube (wow-factor).
- **G5 (end Phase 7)**: reproducible demo from clean clone.

## Explicit Risk-First Sequencing Note

T-6.3/T-6.4 (K8s/Helm) carry the highest uncertainty (R-08/R-18, RSK-04/RSK-11).
Although P2, a **feasibility spike** (minikube start + bare chart install of a
single Portaldot pod) should be scheduled no later than mid-Phase 2 so blockers
surface early; full implementation stays in Phase 6.
